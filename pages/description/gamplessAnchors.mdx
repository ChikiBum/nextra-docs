    {
        "dynamicSizing": true,
        "unitId": 58,

        "closeButtonPosition": "right",
        "withPadding": true,
        "ignoreRootPage": false,
        "scrollValue": 0,
        "hideOnScrollBack": true,
        "type": "top",
        "gam": 0,
        "sizeMap": [
          [[700],null],[[468],[[468,60],[320,100],[320,50],[300,100],[300,50]]],
          [[300],[[320,100],[320,50],[300,100],[300,50]]],

</StyledButton>

Gamless config has two additional prperties:

- `dynamicSizing` values `true` or `false`.

When `dynamicSizing` is set to `true`, it indicates that the advertisement unit is allowed to adjust its size dynamically. This means that the ad unit can resize itself based on the available space or other dynamic conditions such as changes in the viewport size.

- `gam` values `0` or `1`

If `gam = 0` - without google.

If `gam = 1` or miss this property - works without google.

`fluid` size doesn`t work with this type of integration.
